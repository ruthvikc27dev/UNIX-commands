grep "search string" file             #Matches that string in that file
grep "search string" ./*              #Search the pattern in every file in the current directory
grep "search string" ./*.txt          #Search the pattern in every txt file in the current directory
grep "...-...-...." ./*               #(.) - matches any single character
grep "\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}" ./*          #Pattern is same as the above but does not work because grep is not using pro compaitable regular expressions
grep -P "\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}" ./*       #This must work in Linux (uses GNU grep) but not MAC (uses BSD grep)
