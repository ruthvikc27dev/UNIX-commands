/bin                      #Basic binaries are stored here. ls, cat, bash ...
/sbin                     #System binaries where the system adminstrator use, a standard user will not be able to use without permission (root)
                          #/bin and /sbin contain the files and needed to be accessible in single user mode
						  #Single user mode is a special mode that boots you in as root user to allow you to do system repairs, upgrades or test.
						  #Networking is usually disabled in this due to security issues
						  #When you install a program, they are not installed in these folders.
						  
/boot                     #It contains everything required to boot

/cdrom                    #For mounting cd

/dev                      #This is where devices live

/etc                      #etcetra
                          #This is where all the configruations(system-wide) for a program are stored
						  
/lib
/lib32
/lib64                    #This is where the libraries are stored
                          #They are required for the programs to run. /bin /sbin and more
						  
/mnt
/media                    #Other mounted drives
                          #Media was not present before. It was introduced by the distros for auto mounting
						  #To manually mount use /mnt
						  
/opt                      #This is optional folder
                          #Manually installed programs by vendors reside
						  #This is where you can install the software you made
						  
/proc                     #It contains the system processes and resources.
                          #Each process will contain a directory and in that directory information about that process will be present
						  #cat /proc/cpuinfo
						  #cat /proc/uptime
						  
/root                     #It is home folder of root unlike other users

/run                      #This is new and different distros use it differently
                          #tempfs - which means it runs in RAM
						  #This folder is usually emptied when reboot the system, in some occassions you can find some files which are stuck here
                          #Contains run time information when OS bootsup 

/snap                     #This is where snap packages are stored
                          #This is mainly for ubuntu
						  #These packages are self contained packages that run differently than regular packages and applications
						  
/srv                      #This is where service data is stored
 
/sys                      #System folder
                          #This is way to interact with kernal
						  #This is similar to /run

/tmp                      #Temporary directory
                          #This where the applications store temporary information
						  #This folder is usually emptied when reboot the system, in some occassions you can find some files which are stuck here

/usr                      #This is the user application space where the packages are installed which are used by a specfic user
                          #These applications are non essential for basic system operation

/var                      #It contains files and folders that are expected to grow in size
